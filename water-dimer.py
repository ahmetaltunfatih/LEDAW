### Choose the method
# Note 1: Place the proper method your ORCA outputs belong to. Choices: DLPNO-CCSD(T), DLPNO-CCSD, HFLD
# Note 2: Method name is not case sensitive.
# Note 3: The code does not check for the method name in the output files. It is necessary for properly
# combining decomposed LED terms.

method = "DLPNO-CCSD(T)"

# In HFLD calculations, for one-body subsystems, RHF energies rather than reference E(0) energies can be 
# used in conjunction with LED in calculating electronic preparation energies with negligibly small variations.
# If you want to proceed this way, set use_ref_as_rhf_in_hfld = True (default: False or None). Then, if LEDAW
# could not find E(0) energies, it will use RHF energies of one-body subsystems in HFLD/LED calculations.
# CAUTION: This approach cannot use used in open-shell calculations as E(0) corresponds to QRO energy.

use_ref_as_rhf_in_hfld = False

### Convert Hartree to kcal/mol
conversion_factor = 627.5095  # for kj/mol, use: 2625.5

# If you are not happy with the fragment labeling in ORCA supersystem (adduct) LED file
# you can reorder the labels with relabel_mapping variable (default: None, equivalent to [1,2,3,..,the_number_of_fragments])
# As an example, relabel_mapping=[5,3,2,1,4] swaps label 1 with label 5; 2 with 3; 3 with 2; 4 with 1; and 5 with 4.
# Note: This is different than inconsistent labelling the user introduced in supersystem and subsystem
# ORCA jobs. The code automatically standardize subsystem fragment labelings to those in supersystem file.
# Since the present example has two fragments, this is irrelevant.  

relabel_mapping = None

### SINCE THE SUPERSYSTEM (ADDUCT) IS COMPOSED OF TWO FRAGMENTS, ANY OF THE engine_LED_N_body AND engine_LED_two_body FUNCTIONS CAN BE USED IN THIS EXAMPLE:  #
# To demonstrate how to use both functions, in the following, as an example, engine_LED_N_body function is called for BSSE-corrected interaction energy       #
# and engine_LED_two_body function is called for BSSE-uncorrected interaction energy.                                                                         #

### Specify ORCA Output FilesNeeded For N-Body LED Analysis
# Below specify main and alternative filenames with their paths as lists. 
# Note 1: Always specify the output file for the entire system (super system) first in main_filenames and
# alternative_filenames lists. Where necessary, the code differentiate the super system and its subsystems 
# from these lists.
# Note 2: All subsystem output files (even if they do not have LED data as they are one-fragment subsystem)
# must be listed. 
# Note 3: If a part of needed LED data is not present in your main file but present in an another file 
# (such as due to "a crash", or "DoLEDHF False", or absence of "triples"), an alternative file with
# needed data can be specified. Hence, for example, if your method choice is DLPNO-CCSD(T), 
# DLPNO-CCSD output can  still be provided in the main or alternative file name.
# Note 4: The corresponding main and alternative ORCA output files must be given at the same index in the file lists.
# One letter or one number file names may sometimes cause problems. Hence, awoid using such short names, e.g., "A.mpi4.out".
# If you are on windows and using back slash, it is safer to specify all file paths as raw string, e.g., r'.\ORCA-OUT\ADDUCT.mpi4.out'
# Note 5: You do not have to specify any file name for alternative_filenames. But an empty list with the length of main_filenames must be initiated. 
# Note 6: If you specified the same fragment with different labels in supersystem and subsystem ORCA output files, 
# the code automatically labels subsystem fragment labels as in the supersystem output file.
# Note 7: The code only accepts seperate ORCA output files for each system (supersystem and subsystems) and computational setting 
# If you have compound job output, you need to split this file to seperate files for each job.  
# Note 8: Optionally, you can perform Complete PNO Space (CPS) and Complete Basis Set (CBS) extrapolations.
# In this case, you need to specify the path of each ORCA output file with each computational setting.
# For CPS extrapolation, you need two calculations with a looser (LPNO) and a tighter (TPNO) TCutPNO values, 
# such as 1e-6 and 1e-7, respectively.
# For CBS extrapolation, you need two calculations with a smaller (SB) and a larger (LB) basis sets, 
# such as aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ, respectively.
# In the list variables, for example, SB_LPNO corresponds to the calculations with smaller basis set and looser TCutPNO setting.
# The code does not check basis set and TCutPNO values from output files but relies on the user input in the lists below.
